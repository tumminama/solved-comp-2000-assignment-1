 <li><strong>1</strong>.  Given an unsorted array containing <em>n</em> distinct integers, denoted as <em>a</em>[0..<em>n</em> – 1]. Write complete C programs to implement the merge sort algorithms by using</li>

 <li> the recursive algorithm. The program name is <strong>c</strong>.</li>

 <li>the iterative algorithm. The program name is <strong>c</strong>. In your programs, the given array <em>a</em> is sorted in ascending order.</li>

 <li><strong>2</strong>.  Given an unsorted array containing <em>n</em> distinct integers, denoted as <em>a</em>[0..<em>n</em> – 1]. Write complete C programs to implement the quick sort algorithms.</li>

 <li> the partition algorithm proposed by Lomuto. The program name is <strong>c</strong>.</li>

 <li> the partition algorithm proposed by Hoare. The program name is <strong>c</strong>. In your programs, the given array <em>a</em> is sorted in ascending order.</li>

 <li> Given an unsorted array containing <em>n</em> distinct integers, denoted as <em>a</em>[0..<em>n</em> – 1]. Write a complete C program named <strong>c</strong> to implement the heap sort algorithm. In your program, the given array <em>a</em> is sorted in ascending order.</li>

 <li> Write a complete C program named <strong>c</strong> to merge two sorted arrays of integers. In your program, the <strong>merge()</strong> function merges two arrays of integers <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> that are sorted in ascending order into an array of integers <em>c</em> that is also sorted in ascending order. Assume that the numbers of elements of <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are <em>m</em> and <em>n</em>, respectively. The <strong>merge()</strong> function is called in the <strong>main()</strong> function as follows: <strong>c = merge(a, m, b, n)</strong>.</li>

 <li>Write a complete C program named <strong>c</strong> to find the <em>k</em>th smallest element of an unsorted array containing <em>n</em> distinct integers, denoted as <em>a</em>[0..<em>n</em> – 1]. In your program, the <strong>kSmallest()</strong> function returns the <em>k</em>th-smallest number <em>a</em>[<em>k</em>] (0 ≤ <em>k</em> ≤ <em>n</em> – 1) of the given array without sorting the array.</li>

 <li> An <em>n</em>×<em>n</em> lower-triangular matrix, denoted as <em>a</em>[0..<em>n</em> – 1][0..<em>n</em> – 1], is one in which all elements above the main diagonal are zero and the non-zero elements are all found on or below the main diagonal. Write a complete C program named <strong>c</strong> to transfer the elements of the matrix <em>a</em> to a one-dimensional array <em>b</em>, denoted as <em>b</em>[0..<em>n</em>(<em>n</em> + 1)/2 – 1] and vice versa. In your</li>

</ol>

program, the <strong>tran2Dto1DTM()</strong> function stores the elements of <em>a</em> to <em>b</em> and the <strong>tran1Dto2DTM()</strong> function transfers the elements of <em>b</em> back to <em>a</em>.

 <li>An <em>n</em>×<em>n</em> matrix, denoted as <em>a</em>[0..<em>n</em> – 1][0..<em>n</em> – 1] is symmetric if <em>a<sub>ij</sub></em> = <em>a<sub>ji</sub></em>, 0 ≤ <em>i</em>, <em>j</em> ≤ <em>n</em> – 1. Write a complete C program named <strong>c</strong> to transfer the elements of the symmetric matrix <em>a</em> to a one-dimensional array <em>b</em>, denoted as <em>b</em>[0..<em>n</em>(<em>n</em> + 1)/2 – 1] and vice versa. In your program, the <strong>tran2Dto1DSM()</strong> function stores the elements of <em>a</em> to <em>b</em> and the <strong>tran1Dto2DSM()</strong> function transfers the elements of <em>b</em> back to <em>a</em>.</li>

 <li> Write a complete C program named <strong>c</strong> to display the elements of a 2D array <em>a</em>[0..<em>H</em> – 1][0..<em>W</em> – 1] by using the zigzag scan order as shown below.</li>

 <li>Write a complete C program named <strong>c</strong> to display the elements of a 2D array <em>a</em>[0..<em>H</em> – 1][0..<em>W</em> – 1] by using the Hilbert-curve scan order as shown below.</li>
